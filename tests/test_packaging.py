"""Packaging invariants.

Named regression (doc 101). `iamf-sentinel-pro 0.3.1` shipped to PyPI with
`pyproject.toml` bumped and `loom/__init__.py` left at the previous
value, so the distribution and the module disagreed about their own version on
a published release — and PyPI never allows a version to be re-uploaded. The
bump was checked against the README (doc 96 §10.5) and not against the module
beside it. This test makes the pair a gate rather than a habit.
